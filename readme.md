    LINEAR ALGEBRA:

The objective of linear algebra is to calculate relationships of points in vector space.
This is used for a variety of things, but one day, someone got the wild idea to do this with features of a dataset.
We can too! Remember before when we defined the type of data that linear regression was going to work on was called
"continuous" data? This is not so much due to what people just so happen to use linear regression for,
it is due to the math that makes it up. Simple linear regression is used to find the best fit line of a dataset.
If the data isn't continuous, there really isn't going to be a best fit line.
